This is the iOS Facebook Search APP: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L-pA_FdJy6s

Another one I finished is a fullstack web Facebook Search App: http://cs-server.usc.edu:32149/FBSearch.html.
(the website may contain some problem due to the expire of FB API :D)

The iOS App has the following functions:

1. Home screen and a slide out-menu which will provide access to the different screens such as Home,Favorites and About Me.
2. Show the search results.
3. Different Tabs for Users, Pages, Events, Places and Groups with Pagination.
4. Detail Pages with Albums and Posts tabs.
5. Mark Favorites and Facebook Share - social networking features using the Facebook SDK.
